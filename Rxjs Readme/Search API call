Writing AN API which search data from a reddit source

Thumbnails

app.component.html

we need some placeholders in the html to have this images

<div *ngFor= "let result of results$ | async">
    <div *ngIf="result.data.thumbnail != 'default' && result.data.thumbnail !=
    'self'">
      <a [href]="result.data.url">
        <img [src]="result.data.thumbnail" alt="">
      </a>
    </div>
	|async ->this allows us to send the observable straight to the dom element without
	using subscribe to unwrap it.
	async pipe will automatically sunscribe and unsubscribe when the user leaves the page
	
	ngFor - > it is looping through the results$ which is a observable
	
	ngIf -> it is checking whether the result is a thumnail, if yes
	it is showing the thumbnail in the div\
	
app.comonent.ts

we need a query api function to get the data from reddit
queryAPI(searchString){
    console.log('queryAPI',searchString);
    return this.http.get(`https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/search.json?q=${searchString}`)
    .pipe(map(result=>result['data']['children']));
  }
	
	
	we are using httpClient object and calling the get method and mapping the data
	to the result
	
	
	
Next we need a observable results$  and a subject to the get the data from api.
This time we dont need to subscribe to anything as we are using async pipe

 ngOnInit() { 
    this.results$ = this.searchSubject$
      .pipe(debounceTime(200))
      .pipe(distinctUntilChanged())
      .pipe(tap(x => console.log('do', x)))
      .pipe(switchMap(searchString => this.queryAPI(searchString)));

  }
  
  we are using switchMap to wait for the user to search with the last string that 
  he has typed
  
  distinctUntilChanged -> if the search string changes and it is similar to the last query
  string this is going to make sure it does not search with it until the string is changed



Tap-> we are using tap to log the search string
