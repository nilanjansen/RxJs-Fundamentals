fromEvent

how to subscribe to a button click event 

get the fromEvent from rxJs

use this simple code piece

ngOnInit(){
      
      fromEvent(document,'click').subscribe(x=>console.log(x));
  }
  We are creating an Observable from a click event 
  we are subscribing to the button click Observable using fromEvent
  
  Turn event into observable sequence.
  
 debounceTime
 
 suppose in a search bar you expect to query the db without hitting database every time you 
 type a letter
 
 Discard emitted values that take less than the specified time between output
  This operator is popular in scenarios such as type-ahead where the rate of user input must be controlled!
  
  export class AppComponent {
  title = 'rxjs';
  searchSubject$=new Subject<string>();
 ngOnInit(){
      
     this.searchSubject$
      .pipe(debounceTime(200))
      .subscribe(x=>console.log('debounced: ',x));
  }
  ngOnDestroy(){
    
  }
  inputChanged($event){
    this.searchSubject$.next($event);
    console.log('input changed',$event);
  }
  
  console output
  
  
  debounced:  asd
app.component.ts:28 input changed asda
app.component.ts:28 input changed asdas
app.component.ts:28 input changed asdasd
app.component.ts:21 debounced:  asdasd
app.component.ts:28 input changed a
app.component.ts:21 debounced:  a

so finally the searchString would be ahead
